# Friend-Finder

## Assignment

Build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

## Bamazon Customer Portal

The Bamazon Customer Portal allows users to view a table of available items to buy.  The user will be prompted to enter the Item ID number and the quantity to purchase.  If the current stock is greater than or equal to the requested quantity, the order will be completed and the user will see the total amount of their purchase.
